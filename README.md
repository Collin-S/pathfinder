This website is designed to tell you all about the adventures of my pathfinder group!

I will include resources, links, and information about tabletop roleplaying games. We have a navigation menu using flexbox that uses a hamburger button for mobile users.

We have the main content of the page displayed with css grid for a larger viewport where as they are flex when on tablet and mobile sizes.
