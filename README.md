# pathfinder
This website is designed to tell you all about the adventures of my pathfinder group and our ranger's dog!
I will include resources, links, and information about tabletop roleplaying games. We have a navigation menu that uses a hamburger button for mobile users. I use flexbox to organize most of the content on the page as well.
