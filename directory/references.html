        The website <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank">"Roll20.net"</a>is what my group uses to play online since covid started. It is essentially an online tabletop simulator that
        you can use with built in dice, player tokens, and maps. Your Dungeon Master can even make content hidden from the players so that when the players enter a map, they can't see physical parts
        of the map that are beyond their line of sight.

    <p>There is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rpg-scribe-pathfinder-3-5/id1121334119" target="_blank">"RPG Scribe."</a>I use this app on my smartphone and it's amazing! It is a character sheet
    that keeps track of all your stats, spells, items, and pretty much everything you need if you are playing pathfinder. I love it! </p>
