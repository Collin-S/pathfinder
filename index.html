        <p id="p1">I'm here to tell you a story. This story is about a group of adventurers. However, this particular group of adventurers can't make up their minds whenever a decision needs to be made...
        But before we get into that, let's tell you about how I got started playing tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
        <p id="p2">I've been an avid gamer for most of my life. When you play games online with random people from the internet, you tend to find your core group of friends. Within our group, a few of them were roommates and they started talking
        about their Dungeons and Dragons game. The more they talked about it, the more and more I got sucked into the game. Unfortunately, they lived in New York while I was living in Wisconsin
        so my only outlet for D&D at the time was listening to them talk about it. Then one day I decided to look for Youtube videos and I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEMb_RIZ3o" target="_blank">video of Vin Diesel playing D&D</a> with some voice actors.
        After seeing that, I was addicted to watching other people play. When I finally moved to Louisville, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to start a campaign with some of our other friends and thus began... The Adventures of Indecision Division!

        <p class="grid-item1">Let's begin. The group started with five players and one dungeon master. We all decided to meet at one of our houses and start with character creation. Our group consists of two new people to table top RPGs, two that have played before, and then myself who has watched a lot of videos and have
            played one time so I am also fairly new at this point. So then we all decide on meeting on Sunday and then we would end up meeting every other Sunday after that to continue our new adventure. Two o'clock rolls around and we are sitting in the upstairs of Jesse's house waiting to start our character creation. Since most of us are new to this,
            we decide to start with the new people so that everyone can help out along the way. It took us a few hours and by the time we were all done making our new characters and learning most of the basics, we were ready to play! In two weeks... Our group consisted of Yugepor, the halfing rogue. Then we have Krusk, our half orc paladin. The elf sorcerer, Illiris.
            Luchaun is our human fighter. Luchaun was only going to be a special appearance because his work schedule conflicted with our game schedule until he found a new job. Then we also have Esmae, the halfling ranger. And lastly, myself, Blip Bloopbeard, playing as our Dwarf Cleric!</p>
        <p class="grid-item2">Our first actual session of gameplay started out with the party entering in a small town during a local festival. Right away we got roped into playing a game of tug of war with the guards in town. After rolling our dice, we eventually won the game of tug of war and started to celebrate.
            We spent the day celebrating and learning about the new town and the people. The town tells us about orcs attacking the town every so often and losing family members and friends to these attacks. The commander enlists us to help them finding out how to stop them. I'm sure it was becuase he saw our spectacular display
            of strength in our game of tug of war against the guards. We end up spending the rest of the session learning who the important people of the town are and trying to find any clues, but to no avail. Until we end up in the town's new church. There we meet the son of the commander. The old church was burned down. SIDE QUEST!
            We head to the burned down church and investigate. But there are multiple ways to go while inside said church and as a group, we can't decide which way to go first. This becomes a common occurrence in our campaign and this is why we are called "Indecision Division!"
