        <p>I'm here to tell you a story. This story is about a group of adventurers. However, this particular group of adventurers can't make up their minds whenever a decision needs to be made...
        But before we get into that, let's tell you about how I got started playing tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
        <p>I've been an avid gamer for most of my life. When you play games online with random people from the internet, you tend to find your core group of friends. Within our group, a few of them were roommates and they started talking
        about their Dungeons and Dragons game. The more they talked about it, the more and more I got sucked into the game. Unfortunately, they lived in New York while I was living in Wisconsin
        so my only outlet for D&D at the time was listening to them talk about it. Then one day I decided to look for youtube videos and I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEMb_RIZ3o" target="_blank">video of Vin Diesel playing D&D</a> with some voice actors.
        After seeing that, I was addicted to watching other people play. When I finally moved to Louisville, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to start a campaign with some of our other friends and thus began... The Adventures of Indecision Devision!
