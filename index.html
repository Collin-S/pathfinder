        <p id="p1">I'm here to tell you a story. This story is about a group of adventurers. However, this particular group of adventurers can't make up their minds whenever a decision needs to be made...
        But before we get into that, let's tell you about how I got started playing tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
        <p id="p2">I've been an avid gamer for most of my life. When you play games online with random people from the internet, you tend to find your core group of friends. Within our group, a few of them were roommates and they started talking
        about their Dungeons and Dragons game. The more they talked about it, the more and more I got sucked into the game. Unfortunately, they lived in New York while I was living in Wisconsin
        so my only outlet for D&D at the time was listening to them talk about it. Then one day I decided to look for Youtube videos and I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLEMb_RIZ3o" target="_blank">video of Vin Diesel playing D&D</a> with some voice actors.
        After seeing that, I was addicted to watching other people play. When I finally moved to Louisville, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to start a campaign with some of our other friends and thus began... The Adventures of Indecision Division!

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p class="grid-item">Let's begin. The group started with five players and one dungeon master. We all decided to meet at one of our houses and start with character creation. Our group consists of two new people to table top RPGs, two that have played before, and then myself who has watched a lot of videos and have
                    played one time so I am also fairly new at this point. So then we all decide on meeting on Sunday and then we would end up meeting every other Sunday after that to continue our new adventure. Two o'clock rolls around and we are sitting in the upstairs of Jesse's house waiting to start our character creation. Since most of us are new to this,
                    we decide to start with the new people so that everyone can help out along the way. It took us a few hours and by the time we were all done making our new characters and learning most of the basics, we were ready to play! In two weeks... Our group consisted of Yugepor, the halfing rogue. Then we have Krusk, our half orc paladin. The elf sorcerer, Illiris.
                    Luchaun is our human fighter. Luchaun was only going to be a special appearance because his work schedule conflicted with our game schedule until he found a new job. Then we also have Esmae, the halfling ranger. And lastly, myself, Blip Bloopbeard, playing as our Dwarf Cleric!

            <h2>Our First Session</h2>
                <p class="grid-item">Our first actual session of gameplay started out with the party entering in a small town during a local festival. Right away we got roped into playing a game of tug of war with the guards in town. After rolling our dice, we eventually won the game of tug of war and started to celebrate.
                    We spent the day celebrating and learning about the new town and the people. The town tells us about orcs attacking the town every so often and losing family members and friends to these attacks. The commander enlists us to help them finding out how to stop them. I'm sure it was because he saw our spectacular display
                    of strength in our game of tug of war against the guards. We end up spending the rest of the session learning who the important people of the town are and trying to find any clues, but to no avail. Until we end up in the town's new church. There we meet the son of the commander. The old church was burned down. SIDE QUEST!
                    We head to the burned down church and investigate. But there are multiple ways to go while inside said church and as a group, we can't decide which way to go first. This becomes a common occurrence in our campaign and this is why we are called "Indecision Division!" Eventually we agreed on which way to go and explore the 
                    church. Whilst sneaking around, we find a religious looking statue and as I am the cleric, I get excited and proceed to investigate. Well there turned out to be giant venomous centipedes behind it and they jumped out to attack me! This also becomes a common occurrence. I go in first and get jumped by evil doers. Not a big deal
                    though as we destroy their venomous souls and move on. We venture deeper into the church and find a collapsed tunnel and I use detect magic and we find a glowing speck on a dead body in a pile of the rubble. I go to pick up the item when... You guessed it! I get attacked by a ghost rat! Indecision succeeds against the incorporeal
                    rats and we clean up and head out, but not before we see a name scribbled on the wall. What could this name be? This was the end of our first session. I'd say we covered quite a bit of ground for a party of predominantly new players.

            <h2>Session Two</h2>        
                <p class="grid-item">
                    Picking up where we left off, we head to the town from the burned down church and in to the local tavern. On our way to the tavern though, we end up getting attacked by a shadowy figure that commanded three wolves to attack us. Our sorcerer, Illiris was feeling confident and thought they could stand in front. I mean, the wolves were over 100 feet away!
                    Well as it turns out, they can run a lot faster than we can and the wolves reach Illiris in one turn and start to attack her. I jump in front of her to protect her while our rogue, Yugepor chases after the fleeing shadow figure. The wolves are disposed of and we meet up with Yugepor who let's us know that the shadow figure was able to give him the ol' 
                    sliparoo. "Illiris? Have we learned our lesson? Stay behind the people with the big armor. And, wolves are FAST!" Now we finish our route uninterrupted from there and make it to the tavern. There we grab ourselves a celebratory drink and divvy up our loot and then head to our rooms for the night. Each of us grab separate rooms to sleep in and Krusk, our paladin,
                    decides to sleep in a tree outside of town. Paladins... Illiris seduces a random elf while the rest of us try to get some shut eye. All of a sudden I wake up to a creaking noise. Assassins! A group of assassins were sent to kill us in the tavern and since Krusk is outside sleeping in a tree, he's sound asleep and unaware.
                    Everyone else woke up with a humanoid above them and since I woke up to the creaking sound, I was able to get up and get my axe and shield. And Krusk stayed asleep. All but one of the assassins successfully escapes us. The last one started to flee, but Krusk finally awoke from his deep slumber and intercepted the bad guy.
                    As the assassin is running, Krusk knocks him out and we tie him up. After deliberating for what seemed like an actual hour, we bring him back to the tavern to question him. Before we get into the interrogation, we decide to call the session as it was getting late and decide we will pick up from there in the next session.
